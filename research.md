# Construction of 3D models from architectural drawings.

Demands for innovation on the topic of digital de-materialization in managing transformation processes from the building to the territory are putting pressure on the construction industry. 

The process of creating digital artifacts out of old technical drawings is one of the difficulties that the architectural industry is experiencing in terms of archive updates. Digital recreation to current format standards in which businesses operate is a time-consuming and often manual-done procedure.

Municipalities, architecture companies and governments could benefit from a better overview of their built environment. By harnessing Data Science and Business Analytical processes to assess embedded carbon footprint in dwellings, understand overall energy needs, or identify new opportunities within markets, all charged by quantified and comprehensive arguments based on regional, national, or supranational data sets. 

Therefore, the case can be made that an advanced and highly automatized 3D reconstruction workflow that could create BIM-grade models based of paper drawings and adjacent documentation, could be the first step towards creating the aforementioned data sets. An application of sorts would not only “unlock data embedded in paper”, but it could also serve towards pushing for a more digitized and more organized archival system of the built environment.

Moreover, a case could be made towards the aid of generative design, where projects in progress could use a design "auto-complete function" based on previous data on which the application was trained on. 

In the first part of 2022, I conducted a research project which assessed the current state of this topic through a literature review. Additionally, in an attempt to create a software product designed towards a 3d reconstruction based on architectural drawings, small-scale experiments with Computer Vision Libraries were successfully developed on a synthetic dataset. The paper can be accessed [here](/research_project_report_alfi.pdf).

Moving forward, the ambition for my Master Thesis is to build upon previous knowledge and employ Machine Learning methods to automate the aforementioned 3D reconstruction from 2D drawings.

Particularly, the thesis will revolve around training a convolutional neural network model, that can detect (and hopefully classify) windows and door from achitectural drawings. 

The purpose of the model is to attempt to solve one of the sub-problems of the larger, general 3D reconstruction problem. 

Both my research project and master thesis are being supervised by [Stella Grasshof](https://pure.itu.dk/portal/en/persons/stella-grasshof).

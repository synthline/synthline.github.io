Hello, it's me Alex. 

I'm an enthusiastic human with passion towards visual arts and technology. 

My vision for the future is to create and help others design exciting products and services, that can empower people by elevating their life quality in a sustainable way.

In my spare time, I like to design and build IoT- projects with different Arduino micro-controllers, or with Raspberry Pi boards.

I enjoy long walks and I run regularly whilst listening to tech and business podcasts such as "How I built This", "Business Wars", "Wisdom from the Top" or "FT's Tech Tonic".

I also enjoy consuming most types of visual art, mainly cinema and photography, and I often travel to countries from the former Eastern Communist Bloc where I photo-document the local architecture. To see my work, you can take a look [here](https://instagram.com/redconcreteunion).

I hope to add more content in the near future, but until then, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions. 
You can contact me via [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alfi/).

See ya :D
